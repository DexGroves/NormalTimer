# NormalTimer
Learning Android development by creating an app to do blind random timers.

This came up in a poker game. 
Sampling a timer for blinds/ante increases from a known normal distribution of times might be a good way to 
counter people with unfailing internal clocks from playing slow or fast to cheat the increase.
